"""Unified documentation update helpers for OTel GenAI migration.

This module is a placeholder within the compat layer. It was originally
intended to hold utilities for the unified attribute migration from
legacy ``agent.*`` attributes to OTel ``gen_ai.*`` semantic conventions.

No symbols are currently exported. The actual migration logic lives in
``contextcore.compat.otel_genai`` (attribute mappings and transforms) and
``contextcore.compat.operations`` (operation name constants).
