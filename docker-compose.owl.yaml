# Override: Mount contextcore-owl Grafana plugins
# Usage: docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f docker-compose.owl.yaml up -d
#
# Requires the contextcore-owl repo cloned adjacent to this repo:
#   ../contextcore-owl/grafana/plugins/
#
# The plugins (chat-panel, workflow-panel, datasource) are unsigned,
# so GF_PLUGINS_ALLOW_LOADING_UNSIGNED_PLUGINS is already set in the
# base docker-compose.yaml.

services:
  grafana:
    volumes:
      - ../contextcore-owl/grafana/plugins:/var/lib/grafana/plugins:ro
