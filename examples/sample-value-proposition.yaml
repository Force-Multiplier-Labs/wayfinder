# Persona-specific messaging
personas:
  developer:
    relevance: high
    lead_with: "Stop context-switching between 5 tabs to find the bug"
    pain_point: "Spending more time finding errors than fixing them"
    benefit: "AI correlates the evidence, you fix the code"

  sre:
    relevance: critical
    lead_with: "Reduce MTTR from hours to minutes"
    pain_point: "3am pages with no clear starting point"
    benefit: "Structured investigation path with evidence"

      ## AI Error Investigation
      Get root cause analysis in minutes instead of hours.
      - Correlates metrics, logs, traces automatically
      - Suggests fixes based on similar past incidents
      - Documents investigation for future reference
